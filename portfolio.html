                    I've always wanted to work in information technology. I would love to work on it and would like to learn programming
                     and coding asI have always dreamed of creating new software and applications. I find it fascinating how the development of
                      robots and artificial intelligence is reshaping the society we live in. In my school, I have taken part in robot-related events.
                       That, I think, gave me the motivation I required to continue my computer science degree.
